# Blackjack Ruby Sinatra Implementation

A rudimentary blackjack game implementation to demonstrate the things i've learned while training with ruby and sinatra.

### Notes:

- Works best if your browser window is maximize 
- Sound works on chrome but does not work in firefox, safari isn't tested
- Placing a bet doesn't do anything other than displaying your bet. I would have to integrate database storage in the future.
